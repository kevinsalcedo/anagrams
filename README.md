# Anagram of the Day

## About

With the surprise success of word-based games such as Wordle, a friend and I wanted to create our own spin on the genre.

Inspired by 7-letter Scrabble tile racks, Anagram of the Day (AOTD) provides the player with an alphagram: 7 letters sorted in alphabetical order. The goal is to unscramble these letters to find the daily anagram. And don't worry, there's only one solution! If the default game mode, 7s, is too easy for you, you can test your skills with 8s! Just like 7s, you have a 7-letter alphagram. The catch is, this time you have to find the 8-letter anagram! The 8th letter is provided for you in the correct position.

Finding the anagrams too difficult? Use up to three hints to fill in extra letters!

New 7 and 8-letter anagrams are available every day! And if you want, you can go through the archive of all of the previous days' anagrams. We hope you enjoy our take on word puzzle games!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
